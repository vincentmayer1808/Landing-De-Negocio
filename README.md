# My very first web application

For the first time on the web you can see my creations, a simple HTML 5 and CSS 3 landing page application with out any functions! This project may not be very interesting since it doesn't have any features nor a lot of pages as it is the very first programming project I did, but I'm glad to enter the world of the web and I'm looking forward to upgrade this project.

For now, enjoy a simple **Landing Page** for a aromatherapia business where you can see a great application of HTML 5 and CSS 3.
